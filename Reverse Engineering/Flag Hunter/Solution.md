Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,

Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.

Scripts and searches, grep through the void,

Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.

Brute force the lock or craft that regex,

Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?


We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,

No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.

With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,

We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.

Crowd: ;RETURN 1;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,

Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.

Hex and headers, carving out clues,

Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.

Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,

Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.


We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,

No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.

With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,

We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.

Crowd: 
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.

With unity and skill, flags we deliver,

The ether’s ours to conquer, picoCTF{70637h3r_f0r3v3r_a3d964ee}
